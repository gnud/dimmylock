## Supported Versions

Since this is a script and has no dependencies, only service for systemd, that any sudoers based user can edit, there is no need for security concerns, because on a Desktop machine anyone with physical access to the machine can change our password.

So, what's the use of updating the systemd service when a vulnerability is found, when an attacker can simply change the systemd service file to their likings again.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report it, but it won't help anyone.
